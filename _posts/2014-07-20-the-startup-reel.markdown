Where we feature cool startups and talk about them. Suggestions welcome. All things tech-related (which is pretty much everything nowadays).


<!-- Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: -->

<!-- {% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
