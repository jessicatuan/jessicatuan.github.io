ProductHunt is a site that features other cool startups and users can upvote ones that they like. Submit your own startup and you could be featured. Recently, it has garnered substantial press attention as VCs and investors are flocking their way to find the next big "disruptor" there.


<!-- Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: -->

<!-- {% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
