This is Colt's puppy blog where it's 24/7 Colt. Whether he's sleeping, begging for peanut butter, or fetching, yay for puppies.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
